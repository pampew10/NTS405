Windows Investigation

Windows Investigation
The first area of investigation is the Task Scheduler according to the book procedure. This shows the creation of a task in task 
scheduler. Creation of tasks can be done with at command and schtasks command. Tasks can also be accomplished through the GUI interface 
for task scheduler. The viewing of these files (Job Files) can be done through a hex editor or other means. A tool called Jamie Levyâ€™s 
jobparser.py can be used also to achieve information of .job files. Analyzing .txt files involving scheduled tasks can be viewed but 
are encoded in Unicode.

 

Registry Analysis Tools
Autoruns is the tool that I will be using for the registry analysis tools section of this assignment. This tool was chosen because of 
the easy to use aspect, and the popularity support and features of the tool. Using autoruns to view the processes was very inciteful 
and thought provoking as these are not areas you commonly would search in. Nothing major of excitement was found on my personal machine 
but digging deeper and analyzing this area was definitely beneficial.
 

LNK Files and other artifacts
The recycling bin is a tool used in and comes with windows as a form of holding files before deletion. This has a hidden subdirectory 
and has specific user access. The metadata is held in a hidden file \Recycler\<SID>\INFO2



Memory Analysis
One of the tools that will also be used for Memory Analysis is pstools, pslist. Another interesting tool of interest that I investigated 
while using these tools was the psservice tool. This showed services running whether or not they could be stopped and information about 
the services themselves.
